# Problem

URL Shortener
We’d like you to build a website that functions as a URL Shortener:
1. A user should be able to load the index page of your site and be presented with an input field where they can enter a URL.
2. Upon entering the URL, a “shortened” version of that url is created and shown to the user as a URL to the site you’re building.
3. When visiting that “shortened” version of the URL, the user is redirected to the original URL.
4. Additionally, if a URL has already been shortened by the system, and it is entered a second time, the first shortened URL should be given back to the user.
For example, if I enter http://www.apple.com/iphone/ into the input field, and I’m running the app locally on port 9000, I’d expect to be given back a URL that looked something like http://localhost:9000/1. Then when I visit http://localhost:9000/1, I am redirected to http://www.apple.com/iphone/.

Expectations

- Straight HTML or JavaScript.
- Submit the project as a Git archive. Do not include artifacts. We might look at the history.
- A small README is appreciated. A few words about your approach? How to compile/launch your application?
- You may have to make some assumptions. It is expected. Please explain them.
- Good developers write unit tests.
- Use the JVM stack you are most comfortable with.
- No project is ever done/complete. Your job is to convince us that you understood the problem and that we want to discuss your approach with you.
- Do you really want to use a hash function? Think twice and motivate your choice.
- You may want to use external dependencies e.g. database. It’s totally fine! Just tell us more about your choice.
